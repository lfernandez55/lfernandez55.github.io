			Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!<br>
			The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting;<br>
			Merry is May-time, and merry our meeting.</p>

			Fall Moon! Dark be the land!<br>
			Hush! Hush! Oak, ash and thorn!<br>
			Hushed by all water, till dawn is at hand!</p>

		  <p>I sit beside the fire and think of all that I have seen,<br>
			of meadow-flowers and butterflies in summers that have been;<br>
			Of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that there were,<br>
			with morning mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair.<br>
			I sit beside the fire and think of how the world will be<br>
			when winter comes without a spring that I shall ever see.</p>

		  <p>For still there are so many things that I have never seen:<br>
			in every wood in every spring there is a different green.<br>
			I sit beside the fire and think of people long ago,<br>
			and people who will see a world that I shall never know.<br>
			But all the while I sit and think of times there were before,<br>
			I listen for returning feet and voices at the door.</p>

		  <p>In western lands beneath the Sun<br>
			The flowers may rise in Spring,<br>
			The trees may bud, the waters run,<br>
			The merry finches sing.<br>
			Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night,<br>
			And swaying branches bear<br>
			The Elven-stars as jewels white<br>
			Amid their branching hair.</p>

		  <p>Though here at journey's end I lie<br>
			In darkness buried deep,<br>
			Beyond all towers strong and high,<br>
			Beyond all mountains steep,<br>
			Above all shadows rides the Sun<br>
			And Stars for ever dwell:<br>
			I will not say the Day is done,<br>
			Nor bid the Stars farewell.</p>

			I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing.<br>
			Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling,<br>
			Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling.<br>
