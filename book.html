        For the last seven years <a href="https://www.weber.edu/History/susanmatt.html">Susan Matt</a> and I have been working on a book  titled <i>Bored, Lonely and Stupid; Feelings About Technology From the Telegraph To Twitter.</i>  The book is slated for release in the spring of 2019 with Harvard University Press.  Below is a summary of what the book is about: 
        </p>
        <p>        
        This wide-ranging account of our emotional responses to technologies, from the telegram to Instagram, shows that technology not only changes how we feel, but what our feelings mean.
        </p>
        <p>       
        Facebook makes us lonely. Selfies breed narcissism. On Twitter and comment boards, hostility reigns. Pundits and psychologists warn us that digital technologies substantially alter our emotional states. But in this lively and surprising account, we learn that technology doesn’t just affect how we feel from moment to moment―it changes profoundly the underlying emotions themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
        Bored, Lonely, Angry, Stupid examines nineteenth- and twentieth-century letters, diaries, and memoirs and draws on contemporary research and interviews with Americans of different ages and backgrounds to document how our emotions have been transformed by technological change. Where we now strive to escape boredom, earlier generations saw unstructured time as an opportunity for productivity and creativity. Where loneliness is now pathologized, we once thought of solitude as virtuous. Even as we ask whether technology is making us lonelier, it is altering the meaning of loneliness.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a political theorist and software developer who has written and spoken extensively about the impact of technology on education, Luke Fernandez has grappled with many of these questions in the computer lab and classroom. As a social historian, Susan Matt has chronicled the evolution of American conceptions of envy, loneliness, and homesickness. In this timely book, they contend that current technology has removed many of the limits on our emotional landscape. Thus we seek to be constantly stimulated, engaged, and validated, while our anger and antisocial impulses are not only unconstrained but are affirmed by the digital company we keep.

      Americans today worry that modern technology is changing their personalities. Is Facebook making us lonely? Is Google making us stupid? Have we become a nation of selfie-taking narcissists? Are we unable to tolerate boredom? Have we lost the capacity to pay attention? Are we still capable of awe? Such questions abound in the popular press, yet they lack a clear sense of the past. This book recounts that untold story, placing contemporary Americans’ emotional relationship with technology in historical perspective, from the telegraph to Twitter.  The book shows how American expectations about loneliness changed as the solitude of the prairie gave way to loneliness on the net. Once considered an inevitable and perhaps virtuous part of the human condition, today, in an age of constant connection, loneliness has become a psychological problem and a health hazard. Likewise boredom—the word did not even exist until the mid-nineteenth century, for drudgery and monotony were commonplace and unremarkable. Today, however, Americans confess to being unable to tolerate boredom and rely on digital devices to banish it.  Worries about sinful vanity that were sparked by early photography and mirrors have been replaced with anxieties about narcissism on Facebook. This book examines these transformations as well as the changing ways Americans have experienced awe and regarded intelligence.

      <p>
        Using diaries, letters, memoirs, psychological and business texts as well as dozens of interviews with modern Americans, the book rethinks the relationship between our feelings and our technologies. The emotional American of today is not the emotional American of yore; to be bored, lonely, and stupid in the 21st century is radically different than it was two centuries ago.  This book explains how, over the last two hundred years, Americans have developed a new sense of what it means to be an emotionally fulfilled human being in a technological world.
