  Lfernandez.org is the personal Web site of Luke Fernandez.  I am a software developer and computer science instructor at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah.  I code educational software and I specialize in coding secure online testing applications.</p>
  <p>
  In addition to coding and teaching I write articles on digital technology and the way these technologies are shaping (and being shaped by) higher education.  My writing has
  appeared in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Educause Review and Campus Technology (among many other publications).  I also blog at Tech (Dis) Contents.

  I am currently writing a history with Susan Matt on how communication technologies have shaped inner life in America since the emergence of the telegraph.  We are
 are focusing on three themes: techno-idolatry, the way that communication has effected American's commitment to communitarian ideals, and changing perceptions about
 the way that these technologies effect cognition.  We are using the approaches and frameworks that are employed by historians of the emotions as well as ethnographers.  
 These include close looks at diaries, populist commentary as well as first person interviews.

  I haven't followed a traditional path through academe.  I received a doctorate in political science from Cornell University in 1997.  But instead of 
  becoming a full time political scientist I took up the craft, and science, of coding software.  I create digital tools to enhance our ability to learn.  
  At the same time I use the disciplines of history and political philosophy to make sense of our digital tools.
