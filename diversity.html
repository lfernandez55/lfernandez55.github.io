<h1>ETC 2001 -- Diversity Outcomes</h1>

<p>
ETC 2001 is titled “Engineering Culture;” the title, which is a double entendre, describes the dual mission of the course.  Students learn about many of engineering’s cultures.  And in addition, they learn how culture is reshaped by engineering.  Both of these missions encourage students to understand that their perspective is only one among many, how biases inform perspectives of oneself and others, and how rights and entitlements are wrapped up in those perspectives.

In learning about how engineering reshapes culture, the students are exposed to a plethora of artifacts that are created by engineering and how those artifacts impact society.  While most of these artifacts have broadly progressive effects on society, students are challenged to consider the biases that are often built into new technologies and the way those biases can provide advantages to some cultures while disadvantaging others.  In one classic example we explore the civil engineering that accompanied Robert Moses’ urban planning initiatives in New York City.  While this civil engineering enhanced many transportation efficiencies, in some contexts it degraded public means of transport and thereby imposed disproportionate burdens on minority communities and low income residents who could not afford to own their own cars.  In another case we explore the way algorithms, which are often presented as neutral and unbiased, actually function as “algorithms of oppression” that advantage some users while disadvantaging others.   The course doesn’t use the same cases every semester, but it constantly challenges students to consider the multiple cultures that are affected by technological innovation and the way power and rights are redistributed with those innovations.

In learning about the various sub-cultures that actually practice engineering, the course also challenges students to think about diversity issues.  While engineers ascribe to a set of shared values, it’s not a monolithic culture but is instead composed of many subcultures with different perspectives and different beliefs.  Depending on the semester we may explore the differences between the way software engineers and civil engineers practice their profession, the way that some engineers ascribe to instrumentalism while others are more sympathetic to technological determinism, and the way that meritocratic beliefs relate to concerns about diversity in the workplace.  These are helpful lead-ins for looking at who traditionally has been included in the community of engineers and who excluded, and why. Finally, we also apply the emic/etic approaches of anthropology to learn how the culture of engineering not only is defined by how engineers describe it to themselves but as that culture is described by communities who are not part of it.  This also serves to show how engineering culture is itself defined and constructed by multiple perspectives.  Again, in this approach we don’t use the same case studies every semester.  But the course is unfailingly committed to exploring the diverse sub-cultures that make up engineering culture and the way their practices and beliefs relate to other sub-cultures.
